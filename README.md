# RemindME Hinz Hackathon

On the 26th of June 2015, Nick Ruane Presented an Idea at a Health Informatics New Zealand (Hinz)
Health Hackathon. The idea Nick presented was a smart pill bottle, after presenting it Nick met with a wide variety of IT and Health Professionals to see if they could make his idea a reality.so a small group was formed. On the 27th of June the group grew and a brainstorming session commenced during which Nicks original idea transformed from smart pill bottle to a digital med minder but given the time constraints and the lack of engineers the remindme System was conceived a system that not only reminded people to take their medication but could somehow let people with long term medical conditions such as diabetes, or high blood pressure, let them know when there medication amounts are getting low and also allow them to digitally request a rescript of medication from their Doctor.
